<i>Decentralized Custody Engine for Bitcoin</i>
</p>

![CI](https://github.com/nomic-io/nomic/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Nomic is a blockchain which offers a decentralized custody solution for Bitcoin. Built on Turbofish’s [Orga](https://github.com/turbofish-org/orga), a custom high-performance blockchain application framework. Nomic mints nBTC, a token backed 1:1 with BTC, using [IBC](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/) for secure and efficient bridging.


## Running a Node

Running a node increases the health of the network by decentralizing ledger validation and data, even for non-validator nodes. Community members are encouraged to run a node, especially when regularly interacting with the network via transactions and queries.

## Integrating with Nomic

Integrating with nBTC enables accepting Bitcoin deposits with Interchain Deposits to any IBC-enabled blockchain.
